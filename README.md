# SoundCircle

A web app that connects people with similar music tastes at universities

Please head to https://avhormauk.github.io/SoundCircle/index.html to see it live

Note that in order to allow more users into the database, we would have to submit a quota extension request through spotify's developer dashboard, there will be a live demo showing how the user data submission works in our presentation

## Features

- **Spotify Integration:** automatically pulls your top artists and currently playing tracks
- **University-Based Discovery:** browse music lovers organized by university
- **Real-Time Updates:** see what people are listening to right now
- **Privacy Controls:** choose to share contact info or stay anonymous
- **Beautiful Dark Theme:** modern, sleek design with smooth animations

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Spotify:** link your account using secure OAuth authentication
2. **Add Your University:** select your school from the dropdown
3. **Share (Optional):** add your social media handle or stay anonymous
4. **Discover:** browse users grouped by university and find people with similar taste
